# Core Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**

  - Prefer explicit types at feature boundaries (public functions, atoms, storage APIs).
  - Keep types and interfaces close to their domain (e.g., under `src/features/**/types.ts`).
  - Avoid `any`; if unavoidable, wrap it in a well-named type alias.

- **React / React Native**

  - Use functional components with hooks only; no class components.
  - Keep components small and focused; extract reusable pieces into `components/` or feature-level components.
  - Lift state to the minimal responsible owner; avoid deeply nested prop drilling when Jotai/global state is more appropriate.

- **State Management & Atoms**

  - Keep atoms colocated under `src/features/**/_atoms/`.
  - Derive state with selectors rather than duplicating source-of-truth data.
  - Keep atom effects (storage, side effects) thin and testable.

- **Styling & UI**

  - Use consistent spacing, typography, and colors aligned with the assignment’s design spec.
  - Prefer composition over deeply nested conditionals in JSX; extract small presentational components when render logic gets complex.

- **Error Handling & Async**
  - Always handle async errors (network, storage) explicitly; avoid empty `catch` blocks.
  - Fail gracefully in UI with safe fallbacks instead of crashing on unexpected data.
